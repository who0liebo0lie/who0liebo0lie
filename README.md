## Hi there 👋
👋 Hi, I'm Julia Porrino
🔬 Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Biomedical Engineer

📍 Based in Newark, NJ | 💼 Currently at EpiBone, Inc.

🧠 About Me
I'm a biomedical engineer turned machine learning engineer, passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. With expertise in machine learning, statistical programming, and data mining, I specialize in developing predictive models that drive strategic decision-making. I believe in creating longer tables and shorter fences, fostering collaboration and innovation.

Here are some of my notable projects:

🔗 Interconnect
A telecom company exploring predictions of when clients would leave. By discovering at-risk clients, the company plans to offer them incentives to stay.

GitHub Repository: Interconnect

🖼️ Image Data Generator (Computer Vision)
Utilized Keras' ImageDataGenerator to augment image datasets for deep learning in computer vision. Visualized real-time image transformations to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.

GitHub Repository: Image Data Generator
