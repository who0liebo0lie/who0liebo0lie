## Hi there üëã
üëã Hi, I'm Julia Porrino
üî¨ Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | Biomedical Engineer

üß† About Me: I'm a biomedical engineer turned machine learning engineer, passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. With expertise in machine learning, statistical programming, and data mining, I specialize in developing predictive models that drive strategic decision-making. I believe in creating longer tables and shorter fences, fostering collaboration and innovation.

üêç Programming & Scripting Languages (Python, R, Hadoop, Bash,SQL)

üß∞ Tools & Environments (Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Git & GitHub, Stack Overflow (Community Engagement),Render,Streamlit

üì¶ Libraries & Frameworks (Pandas, NumPy, PySpark, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib,Seaborn

üß† Machine Learning (Scikit-learn (sklearn), TensorFlow, Keras, ImageDataGenerator, Spacy

üìê Statistical & ML Techniques (Probability Theory, Statistical Data Analysis (SDA), EDA, Hypothesis Testing, Bootstrapping, A/B Testing, Cross Validation

ü§ñ Machine Learning Concepts (Supervised (Linear Regression,Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests,Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks) ad Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering), Gradient Descent & Matrix Operations, Optimize Hyperparameters, Overfitting, Residuals & Vector Representations, Pipeline Creation, Feature Scaling & Encoding, Train/Test Splits & Model Evaluation, Interpretation of Results & Next Steps


üìà Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:

üîó Interconnect
A telecom company exploring predictions of when clients would leave. By discovering at-risk clients, the company plans to offer them incentives to stay.


üñºÔ∏è Image Data Generator (Computer Vision)
Utilized Keras' ImageDataGenerator to augment image datasets for deep learning in computer vision. Visualized real-time image transformations to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
